# Navbar Affix

A really simple jQuery plugin to make your navbar stick to the top of the window as you scroll. The plugin will automatically calculate the vertical position of your navbar and attach a class to it (or the target if you would prefer the class to be attached to something else) which you can use to fix your navbar to the top of the screen.

## Usage

    $('.your-navbar').navbarAffix();
